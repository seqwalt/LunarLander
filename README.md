# LunarLander
Direct collocation is used to obtain an optimal trajectory for a lunar lander simulation. This is the final project for MATH 514 - Numerical Analysis. Below are some gifs that demonstrate various examples.

-Example of optimal trajectory with path shown:

-Low gravity example with g = 0.1 m/s^2:

-A flip can be achieved by setting the initial angle to 2\*pi, and the final angle to 0:
